# Instagram URL Persistence Fix - Summary

## Problem Discovered
The Android app resets its `target_url` to a default value (`https://example.com`) during initialization, causing URL persistence issues.

## Solution Approach
We implemented a solution that ensures correct URL loading despite this app behavior.

## Key Fixes:

1. **XML Formatting**
   - Fixed XML format in config files for correct quote handling

2. **File Permissions**
   - Added proper permission handling for transferred files

3. **Special Character Handling**
   - Improved escaping of special characters in URLs
   - Fixed quoting in broadcasts and intents

4. **Direct URL Intent**
   - Implemented URL setting via activity intent on app start
   - Overrides default URL even after target_url reset

5. **Test Strategy**
   - Focus on verifying actual app behavior not just file content
   - Test suite verifies URL persists and loads across app restarts

## Results
All tests pass with URLs of varying complexity, including URLs with special characters, query parameters, and complex paths.
