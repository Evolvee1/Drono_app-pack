# Legacy Tools

This directory contains older or redundant tools that have been superseded by newer implementations. These files are kept for reference but are no longer actively maintained or used.

## Superseded By

Most of these tools have been replaced by:

- `settings_api_server.py` - Main API server for device settings management
- `test_settings_api.py` - Client utility for interacting with the API
- `robust_batch_drono.py` - Core implementation for batch command execution
- `direct_url_setter.sh` - Specialized script for setting URLs with high compatibility

## Important Note

Please do not use these legacy tools for new development. Refer to `../README_SETTINGS_API.md` for the current recommended approach.

If you need to restore any of these files to the main directory for compatibility reasons, you can simply move them back.
